  <h2><strong>My philosophy</strong></h2>
  <p>
    In the free coding lessons on Epicodus in the "favorite things assignment" it says just to copy what they wrote. I am not taking their course though I am simply using all of the resources they give out for free on their website. In their list it includes people, but people aren't things, people aren't meant to be used, people aren't meant to be owned, people are worth more than things.
